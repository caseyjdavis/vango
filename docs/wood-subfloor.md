# Installing the subfloor

I decided upon 1/2" baltic birch plywood for the sub floor of the van. It's thick enough not to bend under the weight but not too thick and overkill for just light usage. I lucked out and was able to use the rubber floor mat that came with the van to template the sheets of plywood for cutting. It took 3 4x8 sheets to outfit the van with some scrap left over.

Here's the front section laid out with the cutout for the side step.

Added the second panel in there cutting around part of the wheel wells.

The third section added to the van, I messed up and cut it a little short.

Here's the rubber floor mat laid over the subfloor. Still need to figure out how to cover the exposed wood.

Drilling the holes for the metal rib mounts/studs. I'll cover that in a different post.
