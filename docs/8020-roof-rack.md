# 80/20 DIY Roof Rack

Another trend I see in the #vanlife world and overlanding community are outrageously expensive full roof racks on vehicles. I guess that makes sense for a pickup or Jeep, but the roof of my van is ten feet off the ground. I needed a simple, inexpensive solution to hold solar panels, maybe a Starlink satellite and possibly my traction boards.

I found these aluminum brackets on [DIYVan](https://diyvan.com) for mounting 80/20 extruded aluminum directly to the threaded holes that are already in the roof of the Transit.

After goolging I found exactly what I was looking for, nice and simple. It's 15 series 80/20 aluminum extrusion sitting on top of mounts that attach to the threaded roof openings.

Lots of measuring on a step ladder later, I decided on 74" lengths of 1503-LS extrusion to run down the sides of the van. It's got 3 sides to accept connectors and a smooth 4th side I plan on facing out for a nice finished look.

The brackets come with a 3M adhesive rubber patch to place on the underside of the base to keep it from scratching the roof and provide a little weather barrier.

Applying the rubber patch to the underside of the mount that is already attached to the 80/20.

Here's another shot showing the before/after.

There are pre-threaded holes on the roof of the van that are covered with a rubber patch. I used a trim tool to pry up four stickers to access the threaded insert.

Here's a dry fit of the mount tower with the screws.

The finished look, I like the low stance of the rack and it will support the weight of the solar panels easily.

Here's another look of the rack from the rear of the van.
