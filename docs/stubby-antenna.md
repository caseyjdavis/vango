# Stubby Antenna Install

The van came with a factory antenna that had the coating unraveling and as I drove home down the highway that first afternoon picking it up I knew it had to go. I did a quick search online and discovered the classy looking antenna dubbed "The Stubby"

Nice packaging, made in the USA! :flag_us:

Installation was super easy, 30 second install screwing it in by hand.
