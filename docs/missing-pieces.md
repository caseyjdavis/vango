# Missing Van Pieces

## Front License Plate

The van was in pretty good shape when I received it but there were a handful of missing pieces. The first and important piece to me being in Colorado is a front license plate holder. I purchased the kit online and here is the Ford part number: **LK4Z-17A385-AA** and it was $31.

Here I am dry fitting it to the van, I needed to drill three holes to mount it.

I ended up using the PITTSBURGH 7 in. Poly Hand Riveter Kit from Harbor Freight for easy installation

Looked really nice when the pom rivets where installed in place, license plate firmly in place now!

## Spare Tire

When I purchased the van it did not come with a spare tire so I needed to find a rim to mount a spare tire. I ended up finding a Transit 5 lug rim for sale on eBay for $129.

I took the rim to my local tire shop and had it mounted and balanced for $25. Cranked it up under the van and now I'm ready for a road trip!
