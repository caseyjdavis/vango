# Rusty floor mitigation

Whoever installed the bulk head did absolutely nothing to waterproof or seal the holes so moisture crept through the fasteners and soaked through the protective mat in the back of the Transit. Here is the process of mitigating the rust before laying down flooring.

This was after a light pass of sanding and scraping, fortunately it's just surface rust.

I ended up using Permatex rust disolving gel on the floor and that helped to convert the rust.

At O'Reilly's I discovered heavy sanding discs for car body work and that really sped up the process of cutting down to bare metal.

Here's a shot of the medium sanding disc attached to the end of my drill.

I laid down several thin layers of Rustoleum self-etching primer after cleaning the surface with rubbing alcohol.

Here it is after four coats of primer, starting to look better. :thumbsup:

Finally I laid down several coats of Rustoleum Automotive enamel paint.

I left the floor to cure for several days while I was away so the paint hardened and it was ready for the Bedrug foam mat I was going to lay as the insulating floor layer.

Next up, replacing the raggidty radio antenna. :arrow_forward: [Stubby Antenna](stubby-antenna.md)
