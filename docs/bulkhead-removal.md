# Removing the bulk head

Vincent Vango was a rental van during the first chapter of his life and came installed with a very heavy steel metal bulk head. First order of business was to remove the bulk head to open up the space and make way for installing the seat swivels.

It was mainly a lot of 11mm bolts that I made quick work of with my impact drill.

Full view of the front, it was a very tight against the front seats.

Had to remove the floor piece that was screwed in with rivnuts that ended up being rusty. :cry:

Completely removed, so much more room for activites!

Next up, dealing with the rust I found on the floor. :arrow_forward: [Rusty Floor Mitigation](rusty-floor.md)
