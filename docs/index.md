# Meet Vincent Vango

This is my 2020 Ford Transit I purchased used via an auction here in Colorado. It was a Penske truck in its previous life. The van was a little scraped and dinged up when I picked it up but it was fleet maintained during the first four years of life.

- 3.5L PFDI V6 engine producing 275HP

These are my notes as I baseline and build out the van for weekend adventuring, my remote office and using as a utility vehicle.
