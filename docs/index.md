# Meet Vincent Vango

This is my 2020 Ford Transit I purchased used at auction in northern Colorado. It was a Penske truck in its previous life. The van was a little scraped and dinged up but otherwise in fine shape considering its age. It was fleet maintained so there was always regularly scheduled oil changes and a new pair of front brake pads before I became the owner.

These are my notes as I baseline and build out the van for weekend adventuring, remote office and using as a utility vehicle.
