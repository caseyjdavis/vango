# Thinsulate sidewalls and back doors

I found kitchen shears to be the best tool to use for cutting the 3M SM600L Acoustic and Thermal Insulation. And 3M Super 77 spray adhesive on the van door allowing 30 seconds to get tacky I could just stick the insulation directly to the door.

Using the plastic corregated panels that came with the van made measuring the SM600L insulation easy to do on my living room floor. You can see I taped Low-E Reflective Insulation on the backs of each of the panels

Here's a fully stuffed sidewall of the van ready to be hidden behind a plastic corregated panel
