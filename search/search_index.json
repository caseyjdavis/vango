I guess that makes sense for a pickup or Jeep, but the roof of my van is ten feet off the ground. I needed a simple, inexpensive solution to hold solar panels, maybe a Starlink satellite and possibly my traction boards.</p> <p>I found these aluminum brackets on DIYVan for mounting 80/20 extruded aluminum directly to the threaded holes that are already in the roof of the Transit.</p> <p></p> <p>After goolging I found exactly what I was looking for, nice and simple. It's 15 series 80/20 aluminum extrusion sitting on top of mounts that attach to the threaded roof openings.</p> <p></p> <p>Lots of measuring on a step ladder later, I decided on 74\" lengths of 1503-LS extrusion to run down the sides of the van. It's got 3 sides to accept connectors and a smooth 4th side I plan on facing out for a nice finished look.</p> <p></p> <p>Stay tuned, I am waiting on hardware to show up before continuing work on the roof rack!</p> <p>Next up, a look at the solar panels.

There are a lot of great places to get outside in Colorado and being able to basecamp out of your vehicle makes those places a lot more fun to visit. </p> <p>I think when I really got the bug for car camping was this trip to Moab, Utah camping out of a Mitsubishi Delica I imported from Japan.</p> <p></p> <p>This gradually evolved into bed setup in the back of my 1996 Toyota Landcruiser Prado with a roof rack on top.</p> <p></p> <p>There were several other vehicles along the way and lots of amazing camping trips and now I am excited to have graduated to a high roof van that I (6'2\") can stand up inside! \ud83d\ude4c</p>"},{"location":"bulkhead-removal/","title":"Removing the bulk head","text":"<p>Vincent Vango was a rental van during the first chapter of his life and came installed with a very heavy steel metal bulk head.

But then I realized I really only have a few simple loads to power and didn't want all that space to be sacrificed. So after a lot of research I settled on an Ecoflow Delta 2 Max Portable Power Station.</p> <p></p> <p>Specs:</p> <ul> <li>2048Wh of power!</li> <li>Built in BMS</li> <li>Light and compact in one piece</li> <li>Has power output of up to 3400W.</li> <li>Expandable up to 6kWh</li> <li>Has dual solar inputs up to 1000W. (Perfect for my 2 220 watt solar panels)</li> </ul> <p>I ended up getting this unit on sale for a pretty good price during Thanksgiving 2023. This was before I even had the van but I knew it would be really useful camping or working remotely.</p> <p>But in the van it will fit comfortably under a bench or behind a storage compartment, have easy access to solar cables from the roof and should be much simplier to integrate. </p> <p>The solar panel connected directly to the Ecoflow via XT60 connector. Quick backyard test.</p> <p></p> <p>Charging time in partial shade on the Ecoflow app. Charging time was 40 minutes total in full sunlight.

I feel like I have read a hundred different ways to do it and ultimately I ended up choosing 3M SM600L Acoustic and Thermal insulation for Vincent. This was largely based off the in-depth and excellent website guide from Far Out Ride.</p> <p>There is a large space above the headliner in the front of the van that is a great place to start insulating. Here are the steps to loosen the headliner.</p> <p>Start by removing the two bolts in each handle above the driver and passenger seats.</p> <p></p> <p>There are large cavities on either side of the headliner that need to be filled with insulation. The green tube by the window is the airbag!</p> <p></p> <p>Remove the three clips in the center of the headliner so it can be lowered.

A heavy duty pair of kitchen scissors is great for this thick material.</p> <p></p> <p>I tucked the thinsulate behind the cabling in the door in small sections to make it easier to install.

It was nearly as tall as my front door!</p> <p></p> <p>The box that was labeled \"FRAGILE\" everywhere had footprints all over it so I was half expecting the panel to be broken. I am testing the voltage of the panel with a multimeter to make ensure there are no shorts. If it tests to 21 volts that is in the acceptable range.</p> <p></p> <p>To test the panel, I connected it to the Ecoflow Delta 2 Max I am going to use to power all the systems in the van. I was able to get up to 189 watts of power when the panel was directly facing the sun. Again that's in the +/- 10% range of the panel so that is considered acceptable.
