It's got 3 sides to accept connectors and a smooth 4th side I plan on facing out for a nice finished look.</p> <p></p> <p>The brackets come with a 3M adhesive rubber patch to place on the underside of the base to keep it from scratching the roof and provide a little weather barrier.</p> <p></p> <p>Applying the rubber patch to the underside of the mount that is already attached to the 80/20.</p> <p></p> <p>Here's another shot showing the before/after.</p> <p></p> <p>There are pre-threaded holes on the roof of the van that are covered with a rubber patch.
